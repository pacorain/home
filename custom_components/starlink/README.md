# Starlink custom component

This is a custom component I threw together and am testing before I clean it up and request a pull request into Home Assistant - Core.

It uses the [Starlink python](https://github.com/pacorain/starlink-python) library that I am also throwing together haphazardly for this purpose.

I'll hopefully write more docs soon.
