# My Home Assistant config

This is my configuration for my smart home.

I've laid everything out using Home Assistant's [package system](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/).

## Overview

I have a mix of Zigbee and Z-Wave devices, which I've set up via the UI (so you won't see them here).
