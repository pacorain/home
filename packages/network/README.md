# Network Package

The goal of this package is to gather all of my network-related configuration.

This is where I control and monitor network devices (like computers, network routers, etc.), configure Home Assistant's presence on the network, and monitor the performance of my home's network.

It includes my Home Assistant [HTTP configuration](http.yaml).
